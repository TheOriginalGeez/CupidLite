This readme will get a re-write later.

This is an NSFW Skyrim Special Edition modlist for Wabbajack.

You must be of legal age in your country to use this list.

What to expect: OStim with most of it's addons including the massive expansion for it: ORomance. Open Cities, ton of options for character customization, animated poses, and soon, a small but high quality selection of content and combat overhauls.

# Pre-Installation

## Disable the Overlay

The Steam Overlay causes issues with ENB and should be turned off.

Right click _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition_ in your Library and click Properties, click the General tab and uncheck _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_.

## Change Steams Update Behavior

Skyrim occasionally updates to add Creation Club content. When this happens many mods will break.

To prevent automatic updates from breaking your game reopen the Properties for SSE, click the Updates tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_.

Disable the Steam Cloud too (if you'd like) so steam doesn't automatically put saves into your Skyrim after every install.

## Set the Game language to English

English is required for this list. Any other language than English will fail the installation.

Open the Skyrim Properties window, click the Language tab and select _English_ from the dropdown.

## Clean Skyrim

Before installing this list you should uninstall the game through Steam, delete the game folder, delete the _Skyrim Special Edition_ folder inside `Documents/My Games` and reinstall Skyrim.

**Please do this.**

Especially if you have modded your game before and aren't sure what you're doing. Having old modding files in there can and will break your game.

## Start Skyrim

After you have done everything above and got a clean SSE installation ready, start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

# Using Wabbajack

## Preparations

Create a _working folder_. This folder **must not** be in a common folder like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder near the root of your drive like `C:/Wabbajack`.

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [the Wabbajack site](https://wabbajack.org) and place `Wabbajack.exe` in the _working folder_.

## Downloading and Installing

Downloading and installing this list can take a while depending on your specs. To get the fastest speeds put the working folder on an SSD.

1. Download the latest release here: https://github.com/TheOriginalGeez/Eros/releases
2. Open Wabbajack.
3. Click Install From Disk.
4. Select Eros.wabbajack under Target Modlist. Then, set installation and download paths (EX: D:\Modding\Eros , D:\Modding\SSEDownloads).
5. Click the start button.
6. Wait for Wabbajack to finish.

## Problems with Wabbajack

There are lots of scenarios where Wabbajack can produce an error. Before asking for support try rerunning Wabbajack to continue from where you last left off.

### Could not download X:

If a has been mod updated and its old files got deleted it is impossible to download them. In this case you will need to wait for me to update my list.

### X is not a whitelisted download:

This can happen when I update the modlist. Check if a new update is available and wait if there is none.

### Wabbajack just closed on me. Is it finished?

No, it has crashed and you will need to try again.

### Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

# Post-Installation

## Copy Game Folder Files

- Navigate back to your Cupid installation folder.
- Open "Game Folder Files"
- Copy everything inside the Game Folder Files folder.
- Paste it into your Skyrim SE directory.
  * Just to clarify, since there has been some confusion: there is a folder installed by Wabbajack called "Game Folder Files". The contents of this folder are what you need to copy into your Skyrim folder. Not the folder itself, and definitely not everything that Wabbajack installed on your PC. It's just a few .dll files, a folder, skse_loader, things like that. It's only about 5 MBs of files.

## Installing the ENB

Download the latest version of the ENB files [here](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm) and extract the following files to the root folder of your Skyrim:

- `d3d11.dll`
- `d3dcompiler_46e.dll`

# How to launch the game

Open _ModOrganizer.exe_ inside the Eros installation folder, and select SKSE in the big dropdown on the right and click on the run button to the left of the dropdown. You can also click the shortcut button underneath the run button and click Desktop to add a desktop shortcut to launch the game from. Don't launch the game from Steam, don't launch the game from the Skyrim directory and don't launch from any installation of Mod Organizer 2 *other than the one installed by Wabbajack for EROS*.

# Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

# Cupid Guide

## Creating your character

Using [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) you can create a character from scratch or use/edit one of the many presets included.

To use presets select the presets tab on the top right, press the load presets button and select the preset you want. You can also save your presets here.

Hold down the right mouse button to rotate your character.

If you want your character to stay still open the console, click on yourself and use the `player.sae idlestaticposeastart` command.

## Disable the vanilla Depth of Field.

- Press Esc.
- Go to Settings > Display.
- Move the "Depth of Field" slider all the way down to 0.
- Tab out of this menu until you're back in the game.

## In-Game MCM Options

If the MCM locks up or a menu wont load press tab until you're back in game, then reopen the MCM menu.

Disable the voice pack in the BBLS MCM if you don't like the voices during sex. Check the OStim MCM if you want to tweak OSex (you'll probably want to). Disable everything in the Open Cities MCM. Tweak the Schlongs of Skyrim MCM if you want and you're done.

Ask in the Eros support channel on the Discord if you need any help.
